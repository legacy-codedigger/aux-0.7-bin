/*
 * Seek sort for disks.  We depend on the driver
 * which calls us using b_resid as the current cylinder number.
 *
 * The argument dp structure holds a b_actf activity chain pointer
 * on which we keep two queues, sorted in ascending cylinder order.
 * The first queue holds those requests which are positioned after
 * the current cylinder (in the first request); the second holds
 * requests which came in after their cylinder number was passed.
 * Thus we implement a one way scan, retracting after reaching the
 * end of the drive to the first request on the second queue,
 * at which time it becomes the first queue.
 *
 * A one-way scan is natural because of the way UNIX read-ahead
 * blocks are allocated.
