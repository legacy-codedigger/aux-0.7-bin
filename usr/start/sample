They went to sea in a sieve, they did;
     In a sieve they went to sea;
In spite of all their friends could say,
On a winter's morn, on a stormy day,
     In a sieve they went to sea.
And when the sieve turned round and round 
And everyone cried, "You'll all be drowned!"
They called aloud, "Our sieve ain't big,
But we don't care a button, we don't care a fig-
     In a sieve we'll go to sea!
       Far and few, far and few
         Are the lands where the jumblies live.
       Their heads are green, and their hands are blue;
         And they went to sea in a sieve.

They sailed away in a seive, they did,
     In a sieve they sailed so fast,
With only a beautiful pea-green veil,
Tied with a ribbon, by way of a sail,
     To a small tobacco-pipe mast.
And everyone said who saw them go,
"Oh! won't they be soon upset, you know,
For the sky is dark, and the voyage is long;
