	  trusted hosts.  When an rrrrllllooooggggiiiinnnn(1) or rrrreeeemmmmsssshhhh(1)	request	from
	  such a host is made, and the initiator of the	request	is in

	  That is, rrrrllllooooggggiiiinnnn does not prompt for a	password, and rrrreeeemmmmsssshhhh
	  completes successfully.  So a	remote user is
	  ``equivalenced'' to a	local user with	the same user ID when
	  the remote user is in	hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv.

	  The format of	hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv is a list of names,	as in this
	  example:

		host1
		host2
		+@group1
		-@group2

	  A line consisting of a simple	host name means	that anyone
	  logging in from that host is trusted.	 A line	consisting of
	  ++++@@@@ggggrrrroooouuuupppp means	that all members of that network group are
	  trusted.  A line consisting of ----@@@@ggggrrrroooouuuupppp means that members of
	  that group are not trusted.  Programs	scan hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv
	  linearly, and	stop at	the first hit (either positive for
	  hostname and +@ entries, or negative for -@ entries).	 A
	  line consisting of a single +	means that everyone is
	  trusted.

	  The ....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss file has the same	format as hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv.	When
	  user _x executes rrrrllllooooggggiiiinnnn or rrrreeeemmmmsssshhhh, the ....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss file from _X's
	  home directory is conceptually concatenated onto the end of
	  hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv for permission checking.	However, -@ entries
	  are not sticky.  If a	user is	excluded by a minus entry from
	  hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv but included in ....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss, then that user is
	  considered trusted.  In the special case when	the user is
	  root,	then only the ////....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss file is checked.

	  It is	also possible to have two entries (separated by	a
	  single space)	on a line of these files.  In this case, if
	  the remote user is equivalenced by the first entry, then
	  that user is allowed to log in as any	member of the second
	  entry.  Thus
