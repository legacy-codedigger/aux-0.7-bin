	  This section describes special files referring to specific
	  hardware peripherals and Oreo	System device drivers.	The
	  entry	names are generally derived from names for the
	  hardware, as opposed to the names of the special files
	  themselves.  We discuss characteristics of both the hardware
	  device and the corresponding Oreo System device driver.

	  Some of the entry names are seemingly	arbitrary for various
	  historical reasons.
